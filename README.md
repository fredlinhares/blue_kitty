# BlueKitty

BlueKitty is a minimal 3D game engine for the Ruby language. It intends to be a middleware between your code and system running it.


This project is a work in progress; currently, it is not suitable for any serious project.

## Installation

This gem links against SDL2 and Vulkan, so you need the development libraries installed on your system before installing this gem. Also, you need the GLSL compiler.

For Debian/Ubuntu systems use:

    $ sudo apt install libvulkan-dev libsdl2-dev glslang-tools

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'blue_kitty'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install blue_kitty
